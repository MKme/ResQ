# Code Notes

To program the ESP8266 you need to install the Arduino IDE, ESP8266 board support within the IDE and the CH340 USB to Serial driver (if not already installed on your PC)
To do this follow the tutorial here:

NOTE: ResQ kits come with the ESP8266 programmed with the current ResQ firmware at the time of manufacture. 

Install the supporting libraries called out in the sketch (they are also included as backups in the GitHub Repo for you as libraries can be broken by new development.  Needed libraries are: 

•	ArduinoJson

•	TinyGPSPlus-1.0.2/TinyGPSPlus-1.0.2

•	U8g2-2.27.6

•	EspSoftwareSerial-6.8.1.zip


For help installing libraries see this video:

Flash the most current ResQ firmware (sketch) found on GitHub here: https://github.com/MKme/ResQ/tree/master/Code


## TIPS- 

-  I have the PCBs avaialble on my website here: http://store.mkme.org/product-category/custom/
-  Backups of the working libraries are found in this directory
