# RESQ Open Source Wifi based Search and Rescue Devices
Moving super secret source to Git for sharing on Hackaday- time to give ths project away  Show it some love with a like on Hacaday IO here: https://hackaday.io/project/172090-resq-search-and-rescue-tools


This open source project uses AP beacon packet sniffing from any commercially available aircraft/drone or manned aircraft OR by a handheld YAGI antenna unit to locate people on the ground such as lost hikers, 
campers or even poachers on game preserves etc This will work even in areas where their cellphones cannot connect to any cell tower- handy.  The aircraft dtects the AP beacon from their cellular phone, records the GPS coordinates for later ground use and transmits an alert to search teams on the ground

# Enclosure/CAD Files Notes
- V1.4 Air unit case is first compatible enclusure for V1.1 PCBs/Gerbers as manufactured/supplied
- All boards and enclusures will follow version 1.XX will be compatible with all 1.XX PCBs and onward to 2.xx etc
- This project is my first made with Fusion 360 
- This was made from the awesome Adafruit Tutorial here (Thanks Noe!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVmOtM60VWw
- The box is fully parametric in Fusion so you can easily modify it as your needs/expansion or future changes to this project- HANDY!

# PCB Notes
## V1.1 
First to be manufactured (PCBWay)
- OLED is powered by 5V not 3.3V (just note in case yours is not 5V tolerant)
- OLED Wiring startes with VCC on the end then GND- Apparently almost every other OLED in the world outside my shop starts with GND then VCC
- OLED can be wired backwards as above point and burn your fingers....twice.... but still works after.... sigh....

## V2.1 
Project files done in KiCAD
- OLED is now powered 3.3V 
- OLED VCC and Grnd reversed to accomodate the much more common pin layout 
- Spare Signal wires now routed and dont need bodge wires if used
- Serial lines broken out for teletry transmission via LORA radio (or other UART radio module)

# Camera Expansion Module (Winter 2020 ETA)

I would like to develop the expansion module to automatically capture images when target is aquired. This is planned to simply use an ESP32 with camera
module. With the single GPIO I will use this as an interrupt driven signal to wake the ESP from deep-sleep then begin capturing images to the SD card
I may do other methods but for now it makes sense in my mind to use the ESP32 due to weight and power considerations. In deep sleep this should be a simple addition
to the air unit whihc will draw virtually no powe runtil capture is needed. 

The images can be used to correlate with the satellite imagery or existing aircraft FPV DVR footage.  It may be handy to have standalone images to quikly review any target detected.
