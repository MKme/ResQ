iNav fully updated and old settings manually inputted. 433mhz telemetry working for wireless/mission
July 2020
inav fully tested- just needs final autotune or pid adjustments
trim good
all modes working
transition to RTH is still rough and too high throttle- would be nice to reduce this but seems to rely on rate or some combination
