# Aircraft Notes 

See my YouTube videos in the ResQ playlist and also see my entire Github repo devoted to my drone configs (ALL OF THEM) here:

https://github.com/MKme/DroneConfigs

See the CAD files folder for my 3D printed parts

In the iNav folder you will find all my iNav config files for the Nano Talon. You should be able to use them directly in your build should you use the same airframe.  

More configs coming Fall 2020 when I build the new heavy-lift quadcopter. 

## TIPS- 

-  I have the aircraft and quacopter parts avaialble on my website here: http://store.mkme.org
