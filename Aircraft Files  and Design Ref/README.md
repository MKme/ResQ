# Aircraft Notes 

4-1-2020   iNav fully updated and old settings manually inputted. 433mhz telemetry working for wireless/mission

July 2020  inav fully tested- just needs final autotune or pid adjustments

trim good

all modes working

transition to RTH is still rough and too high throttle- would be nice to reduce this but seems to rely on rate or some combination


See my YouTube videos in the ResQ playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyM2a_cfnzifVreG8aKurH-9nNYl8QLr

and also see my entire Github repo devoted to my drone configs (ALL OF THEM) here:

https://github.com/MKme/DroneConfigs

See the CAD files folder for my 3D printed parts

In the iNav folder you will find all my iNav config files for the Nano Talon. You should be able to use them directly in your build should you use the same airframe.  

More configs coming Fall 2020 when I build the new heavy-lift quadcopter. 

## TIPS- 

-  I have the aircraft and quacopter parts avaialble on my website here: http://store.mkme.org
