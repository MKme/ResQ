## Laser Cutter Settings
On my K40:

Raster: 10% power 100mm/selections

Vector Cuts: 60% power 3mm/s for 3mm acrylic

I dont have one yet but if you have tips please let me know so I can add them to the assembly guide and this doc!

## Hand cutting

Print out the design on paper then trace it on your materil of coice and cut it out.  Just that easy! 

### TIP: 

Use DollarTree foam board then just wrap it in packing tape for a super durable enclosure that costs you a dollar.
