# Enclosures Assembly-Manufacturing Guide Readme

### Welcome to the Erics land of enclosures where we set you up with a shiny new case for your project. 

Here we have a variety of selections for your ResQ build.  Choose from the standard CAD files and .stls for 3D printing

###or

Try out the new and improved 2D svg files to laser, CNC or even hand cut your own!  No special equipment needed anymore. 

## 3D Printer Settings

Print in your material of choice. I use PLA:

- 0.3mm Layer height

- 210C extruder

- No Supports

- 15% Infill Rectillinear

## Laser Cutter Settings
On my K40 (40 Watt Chinese laser cutter) :

### Acrylic

- Raster: 10% power 100mm/second

- Vector Cuts: 60% power 3mm/s 

### 3mm Birch Plywood

- Raster: 11% power 100mm/second

- Vector Cuts: 60% power 3mm/s 


## CNC
I dont have one yet but if you have tips please let me know so I can add them to the assembly guide and this doc!

## Hand cutting

Print out the design on paper then trace it on your materil of coice and cut it out.  Just that easy! 

### TIPS- 

- Hand made verision : Use DollarTree foam board then just wrap it in packing tape for a super durable enclosure that costs you a dollar.  

- Modify the Box files yourself- If you want different dimensions simply go to this site: https://en.makercase.com/#/ Enter the dimensions you want and export the .svg for FREE
