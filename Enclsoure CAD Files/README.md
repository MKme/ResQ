# Enclosures Assembly & Manufacturing Guide

### Welcome to Erics land of enclosures where everyone leaves with a shiny new project case. No matter what tools you have we have a case for you. No money down, no interest for all the days!

Here we have a variety of selections for your ResQ build.  Choose from the standard CAD files and .stls for 3D printing

### or

Try out the new and improved 2D svg files to laser, CNC or even hand cut your own!  No special equipment needed anymore. 

## 3D Printer Settings

Print in your material of choice. I use PLA:

- 0.3mm Layer height

- 210C extruder

- No Supports

- 15% Infill Rectillinear

You find ALL my i3 printer settings in GIT here:  https://github.com/MKme/I3-Mega-3D-Printer-Settings-Resources

Or All my CR10 settings and profiles in GIT here:  https://github.com/MKme/CR10-3D-Printer-Settings-and-Reference

## Laser Cutter Settings
On my K40 (40 Watt Chinese laser cutter) You can find all my reference and info for the K40 in my Git Repo Here: https://github.com/MKme/Laser-Cutter

Settings Used for these designs: 

### Acrylic

- Raster: 10% power 100mm/second

- Vector Cuts: 60% power 3mm/s

### 3mm Birch Plywood

- Raster: 11% power 100mm/second

- Vector Cuts: 60% power 3mm/s

## CNC
I dont have one yet but if you have tips please let me know so I can add them to the assembly guide and this doc!

*EDIT* I bough a 3018 CNC to test these 2D files and see how they cut compared to the laser. If there is anything I can do to fix them for others to easily make them I will. 

## Hand cutting

Print out the design on paper then trace it on your material of choice and cut it out.  

Just that easy! 

### TIPS- 

- Hand made verision : Use DollarTree foam board then just wrap it in packing tape for a super durable enclosure that costs you a dollar.  

- Modify the Box files yourself- If you want different dimensions simply go to this site: https://en.makercase.com/#/ Enter the dimensions you want and export the .svg for FREE

## Enclosure/CAD Files Notes

V1.4 Air unit case is first compatible enclusure for V1.1 PCBs/Gerbers as manufactured/supplied

All boards and enclusures will follow version 1.XX will be compatible with all 1.XX PCBs and onward to 2.xx etc

This project is my first made with Fusion 360

Fusion 360 models were made from the awesome Adafruit Tutorial here (Thanks Noe!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVmOtM60VWw

The fusion 360 boxes are fully parametric in Fusion so you can easily modify it as your needs/expansion or future changes to this project- HANDY!
